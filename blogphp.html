                    <p>Michael "Mike" Wazowski is a fictional character who appears in Disney/Pixar's Monsters Inc. franchise. He is a green one-eyed round monster with two arms, legs, and small horns. In the films, Mike is one of the two protagonists, alongside James P. Sullivan, and is primarily voiced by Billy Crystal in the film series, shorts, and the Disney+ series.</p>
                    <p>Mike runs Sulley's station on the scare floor and they are close friends and roommates. Mike is in a relationship with Celia Mae at this time. Additionally, Mike helps Sulley in his mission to save Boo. While Sulley bonds with Boo, Mike desperately wants her gone. Randall finds out his involvement from the glimpse of him near Boo in a newspaper and Mike makes a deal with him to return Boo. However, this makes Sulley suspicious and Mike tries to prove him wrong. Randall ends up kidnapping Mike for the scream extractor. At the last second</p>
                    <p>On a class field trip to Monsters, Inc., Mike is inspired to become a professional scarer. He gets accepted into the Monsters University scare program, where he meets both James P. Sullivan and Randall Boggs in a SCARE 101 class. Mike initially dislikes Sulley for his arrogance and bad work ethic. He likes Randall because he's a Scaring major and his roommate at the time. It is seen that Randall and Mike hangout a lot by studying and even sitting next to each other in class.</p>
